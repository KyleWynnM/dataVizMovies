This is a two pronged project both centralizing around the same CSV!

The CSV is data from ~1000 movies off of IMDB
The fields include actors, genres, runtime, revenue, release year, and more!

The first prong is a customized scatter plot.
You decide what you want to see. You can choose the X-Axis and the Y-Axis!
Then you can decide what genres you want plotted, or what actor you want plotted
You can hover over each dot to see what movie it is!

The second prong is an actor network.
It is a graph of actors linked by shared movies. It is a bit of a mess at the current moment, but I think it has high potential!
